# Lab description
Tasks 1-6 completed.

### Task 1 - Backfill Feature Group
Notebook 1_air_quality_feature_backfill.ipynb is responsible for backfilling the feature group with historical data.

### Task 2 - Daily Feature Pipeline

Notebook 2_air_quality_feature_pipeline.ipynb runs daily to update the feature group with the latest data.

### Task 3 - Training Pipeline

Notebook 3_air_quality_training_pipeline.ipynb trains the machine learning models using the data from the feature group.

### Task 4 - Batch Inference Pipeline

Notebook 4_air_quality_batch_inference.ipynb performs batch inference using the trained models to predict air quality.

### Task 5 - Monitor accuracy
Notebook 4_air_quality_batch_inference.ipynb also includes the monitoring.

### Task 6 - New features, lagging air quality
This is incorporated in all of the notebooks.
